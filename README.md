# notifier

NotifyManager reads notify conditions from a source (e.g. yaml file) and tries to
notify the external API about the changes that are explicitly specified in the conditions.

The yaml file is just an example here and it can replaced by any other source (e.g. database, raw files, pickled objecs and ...)
